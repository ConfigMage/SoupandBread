Good evening.

Your mission… should you choose to accept it…

[long pause]

Is deceptively simple.

Step one.

Toast the bread… in the air fryer.

[short pause]

Step two.

Warm the soup… in the microwave.

[short pause]

Step three.

[long pause]

[short pause — slight dramatic swell]

[COUNTDOWN — slow, authoritative]

In five…
four…
three…
two…
one.
