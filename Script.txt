[VOICE: calm, serious, cinematic — slight reverb]

Good evening.

Your mission… should you choose to accept it…

[long pause]

Is deceptively simple.

Step one.

Toast the bread… in the air fryer.

Step two.

Warm the soup… in the microwave.


Step three.

Dip the bread.

And finally…

Change. Your. Life.


This message will self-destruct…



In five…
four…
three…
two…
one.
